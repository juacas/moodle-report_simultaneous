# Simultaneous usage Report #

This report is intended to provide teachers with a simple tool to detect possible cheating by students during online assessment.

The results shown are merely indicative and are not conclusive evidence of illicit activity.

This report only analyzes Moodle activity logs to count the number of various user activity events during a time interval.

The teacher can analyze all enrolled users or select a set of reference activities to extract from them the list of users to analyze.

The report performs the following searches:
- User visits anywhere in the course. If selected, reference activities are excluded.
- User visits in any part of the entire server (includes other courses).
- Instant messages sent by each user.
- Actions performed on messages by each user. For example: delete, read, write instant messages.
- Messages sent to conversations with other analyzed users.
- Different IPs used by a user.

The plugin does not give details of the detected actions, it only gives the counting of detected events.

If a teacher suspects inappropriate activities, he/she can make a more detailed analysis of his/her course logs or ask the administrators for help for further investigation.
